<h1>DESIGN INSPIRATION</h1>

<h2>CASE STUDIES</h2>

<P class= "inspiration">
    Following in the footsteps of Japanese architecture creating a zen atmosphere was one of the key aspects of this project. From further investigation the environment a young adult is placed in has a huge impact on their mental wellbeing. As they are young adults, many may not feel comfortable confiding in someone as a form of therapy, therefore I wanted to offer an alternative method in which the space they are in is therapeutic, as well as stimulating. 
    In order to understand the best way to create such a space for young people a lot of research and inspiration was required to create the perfect space. This included conducting surveys, in-depth research to forms of therapy as well as design case studies.
