    <h3>PROJECT BRIEF</h3>
    <br>

    <p class= "harringay">
        Harringay has one of the highest percentages of domestic violence attacks, of all contacts to “Children and Young People Services” in Haringey, 70-80% involve domestic abuse, due to lack of communication and fear most crimes go unsolved, leaving the victims venerable. The safe house is a project designed for young adults ranging from 16-21, who have experienced some form of domestic violence, or abuse and are in need of a safe space to stay. The safe house provides rehabilitation for youth, a gym, an indoor garden and a place for them to sleep and have their own space. The project consists of a therapy area which is an indoor garden, a gym area including boxing and yoga, a study area with a library and separate sleeping area. 
    </p>

    <br>

    <p class="safehouse">
        The safe house project will give young adults a chance to develop in a healthy environment, mentally and physically but also learn many new skills such as using the outside space to allow them to garden or grow fruit and vegetable. Develop communication skills by having therapy and help available to them. The sports area will allow them to take part in new activities and help them learn how to master their mind. Finally, the study area will allow them to progress and complete their studies to the best of their ability.
